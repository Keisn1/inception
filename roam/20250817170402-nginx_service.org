* *volumes*:
- map directories or files from the host filesystem to the container filesystem
- This allows for data persistence and sharing between the host and the container
- facilitates keeping data outside of the container's lifecycle, meaning that even if a container is removed, the data in the volume persists.

* *ports*:
- forward or map a port on the host machine to a port in the container
- This allows external access to the services running inside the container
- The typical syntax is =host_port:container_port=, enabling network traffic on the host port to be directed to the specified port on the container.
