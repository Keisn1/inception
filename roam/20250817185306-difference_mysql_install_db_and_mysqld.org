* what's the difference between mysqld and mysql_install_db (from the dockerfile) ?

Great question! These are two different tools with distinct purposes:

*=mysql_install_db=* (from Dockerfile):
- /Installation utility/ - sets up the initial MySQL system
- Creates the basic database structure (=mysql=, =information_schema=, etc.)
- Sets up system tables for users, privileges, etc.
- Creates initial files and directories
- /Runs once/ during setup
- Think: "prepare the foundation"

*=mysqld=* (the server daemon):
- The actual /database server process/
- Handles SQL queries, connections, transactions
- Reads/writes to the database files created by =mysql_install_db=
- /Runs continuously/ to serve clients
- Think: "the actual service"

*In the workflow:*
1. =mysql_install_db= → Creates empty MySQL system (Dockerfile)
2. =mysqld --bootstrap= → Runs server briefly to execute setup SQL (script)
3. =mysqld= normally → Serves database requests (container runtime)

*Analogy:*
- =mysql_install_db= = Building a house foundation and basic structure
- =mysqld --bootstrap= = Moving in furniture before opening
- =mysqld= = Living in the house and welcoming guests

Without =mysql_install_db= first, =mysqld= would have nothing to work with - no system tables, no user accounts, no database structure.
