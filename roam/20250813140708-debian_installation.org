* Check checksum
** what is it
- says that the data has not been tempered with

** How to
1. download checksum with wget or curl
2. use  =hashAlgo -c checksum= where
   - hashAlgo is the algorithm that the data was hashed with
   - checksum is the file you've downloaded

* signature
** what is it
- verify the origin of data (checksum in that case)
** how to
1. data is being hashed
   - the hash is being encrypted with a private key of the origin = =signature=
2. user receives can download the signature and decrypt it with the public key
   - signature is base64-encoded
   - You can inspect it with GPG:
     #+begin_src bash
 gpg --list-packets SHA512SUMS.sign
     #+end_src
   - hash-algo is part of the signature-meta data
3. user might need to trust the public key of the owner (against warnings)
     #+begin_src bash
     gpg --keyserver keyring.debian.org --recv-keys DF9B9C49EAA9298432589D76DA87E80D6294BE9B
     gpg --edit-key DF9B9C49EAA9298432589D76DA87E80D6294BE9B
     # In GPG prompt: trust → 5 (ultimate) → y → quit
     #+end_src
4. verify the signature
   - decrypt it with public key
   - create hash of data
   - compare
     #+begin_src bash
gpg --verify SHA512SUMS.sign SHA512SUMS
     #+end_src

* Installation
1. Create virtual machine
   - 2 GB RAM
   - 8 GB disk
   - VDI format
   - 2 cores
