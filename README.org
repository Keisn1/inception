#+title: Readme

* General Guidelines
- [ ] must be completed on a virtual machine
- [ ] all files need to be under srcs folder
- [ ] Makefile located at root of directory
  - [ ] must set up the entire application
  - [ ] has to build Docker images using =docker-compose.yml=

* Mandatory Part
- [ ] each image must have the same name as its corresponding service
- [ ] each service has to run in a dedicated container
- [ ] each container must be built either from *penultimate stable version* Alpine or Debian
  - one step behind the most recent stable release
- [ ] write one Dockerfile per service
  - [ ] Dockerfiles must be called in your docker-compose.yml by your Makefile
  - [ ] means, build your Docker images yourself
  - [ ] no Dockerhub (Alpine/Debian excluded)
- [ ] containers must restart automatically in case of crash

** Container
*** NGINX
- [ ] TLSv1.3 or TLSv1.2
*** WordPress
- [ ] with php-fpm only (must be installed and configured)
- [ ] without NGINX
*** MariaDB
- [ ] without NGINX
*** Volume 1
- [ ] contains WordPress database
*** Volume 2
- [ ] contains WordPress files
*** docker-network
- [ ] establishes connection between the containers
** Exclamation point
- [ ] must not use commands that create infinite loops as a way to keep the process running
- [ ] no Hacky solutions like =tail -f=, =bash=, =sleep infinity=, and =while true=
  - without a long-running command specified in the Dockerfile, a container will exit/shutdown immediately after starting
  - configure a proper entrypoint
- [ ] read up on how daemons work to run services in a container properly
- [ ] no =network: host=
  – a configuration that gives the container access to the host's networking stack.
- [ ] no =--link= or =links:=
  – legacy options for connecting containers.
- [ ] must have a =network= line in the =docker-compose.yml=
- [ ] passwords not present in Dockerfiles
- [ ] .env and secrets
  - [[https://42born2code.slack.com/archives/CN9RHKQHW/p1745060462370869][Chat on Secrets and .env]]
  - [ ] use .env to store environment variables
  - [ ] use Docker secrets to store any confidential information
- [ ] Nginx container is sole entrypoint into your infrastructure
  - [ ] port 443
  - [ ] TLSv1.3
** Best practices
- [ ] Using a proper init system or handling child processes to manage PID 1 characteristics.
- [ ] Following multi-stage builds for smaller images.
- [ ] Specifying exact versions for dependencies.
- [ ] Minimizing the number of layers by combining commands where practical.
- [ ] Avoiding the use of root where possible for security reasons.
- [ ] Keeping the image smaller by cleaning up unnecessary packages.
** WordPress
- [ ] 2 users
  - [ ] administrator
    - [ ] must not contain any form of 'admin' or 'administrator'
  - [ ] another user
** volumes
- available under /home/kfreyer/data of the host machine
* Bonus
- you may open more ports to suit your needs
- [ ] setup =redis cache= for WordPress Website
- [ ] setup =FTP server= container pointing to the Volume of WordPress website
- [ ] create a simple static website in the language of your choice
- [ ] Setup =Adminer=
- [ ] Setup Service of your choice. Need to justify it during evaluation
